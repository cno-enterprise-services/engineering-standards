# Enterprise Services Engineering Standards

Our team follows a consistent set of practices to ensure quality, collaboration, and maintainability across all projects. These standards apply to all engineers and contributors, regardless of role or urgency.


## 1. System Design First

Begin with a diagram of the system before writing code.

Start with high-level blocks to show the big picture, then add detail as needed.

This ensures shared understanding and alignment before development begins.


## 2. Request for Comments (RFC) Process

What’s an RFC?

An RFC (Request for Comments) is a short document to propose a design or change and invite peer review before serious work starts.

When to use: new patterns, system designs, technology choices, or any change that impacts multiple people or systems.

### Expectations:

Authors acknowledge all feedback.

A decision-maker is clearly named.

Every RFC has a revisit date to reflect on results.


RFCs and diagrams must be stored in GitHub.

Approval of an RFC signals that serious work may begin.


### RFC Template

Save RFCs as docs/rfcs/NNN-title.md:

```markdown

# RFC: <Concise Title>

## Header
- **Authors:** <name(s)>
- **Decision Maker / Approver:** <role or person>
- **To be reviewed by:** <YYYY-MM-DD>
- **Revisit date:** <YYYY-MM-DD>
- **State:** Draft | Feedback Requested | Accepted | Rejected | Superseded

## Summary
Concise explanation of what is proposed and why it matters.

## Context / Need
Describe the problem, constraints, and why existing approaches are insufficient.

## Proposal (What/Why)
- Objectives & non-goals
- High-level design (link/embed diagram)
- Key decisions and rationale
- Scope / out of scope

## Alternatives Considered
Briefly compare 2–3 options and why this proposal wins.

## Risks & Mitigations
Technical, product, security, operational, organizational.

## Rollout Plan
- Phases/milestones
- Owners
- Backout/rollback strategy

## Impact
Teams/systems affected, API/contract changes, CI/CD implications, cost/performance.

## Test & Quality Strategy
Test plan, coverage expectations, and success criteria.

## Open Questions
Where you want explicit feedback.

## Feedback Log
- <date> — <reviewer> — <feedback summary> — **Ack:** incorporated / declined (reason)

## Metrics & Revisit
- Leading and lagging indicators
- What we’ll check on revisit date
- Owner of follow-up

## References
Links to prior RFCs, docs, tickets, benchmarks.

```

## 3. Source Control and Collaboration

All code must be in source control.

Developers perform regular check-ins to avoid large, unreviewable changes.

Code reviews are mandatory for all contributions.



## 4. Testing and Quality Assurance

Thorough tests must be written to verify system functionality.

Test Driven Development (TDD) is encouraged but optional.

What matters is sufficient test coverage and automated verification.

Tests must run in CI/CD pipelines (eventually).


## 5. Branching and Release Management

Work must be done in feature branches.

Promotion process:

1. Create a pull request (PR) when a feature is ready.


2. PR reviewed and approved → merge into test branch.


3. After testing, repeat PR/review to merge into production branch.



## 6. Universal Standards

These standards apply to everyone, regardless of role, project, or urgency.

No code may be released without following the established process.

✅ By combining design-first thinking, the RFC process, rigorous testing, and consistent review practices, our team ensures that all systems are maintainable, reliable, and aligned.
